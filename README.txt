The Drupal plugin extends Z-Ray to display detailed information on all the elements working under the Drupal hood. You'll be able to see a list the modules loaded on your page, together with the hooks and actions they invoked during the request. In addition, you'll be able to see a list of functions called during the request and all the forms used on the page. Last but not least - Z-Ray will display useful information on the current user.
